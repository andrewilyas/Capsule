# Capsule
Capsule, a social network made for MIT's January Web Programming Competition (6.148)

# What it is
Capsule is a social network modeled around the idea of a time capsule. Users submit predictions, and can upvote, downvote, or re-predict the predictions of others. After a certain amount of time, the predictions are buried for a while. During this phase, Capsule will monitor the web through some scraping algorithms, and find articles and trending hashtags related to the user's prediction. At the end of the burial phase, all the buried predictions are uncovered, along with top articles and hashtags that trended while they were buried, allowing the user to see how close they got.

# About
Capsule was created for the 6.148 Web Programming Competition Class by Andrew Ilyas, Kenny Gea, and Reece Tamashiro.
